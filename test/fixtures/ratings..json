        "comment": "Parents need to know that this thrill-a-minute story, the first in the Harry Potter series, respects kids' intelligence and motivates them to tackle its greater length and complexity, play imaginative games, and try to solve its logic puzzles. It's the lightest in the series, but it still has some scary stuff for sensitive readers: a three-headed dog, an attacking troll, a violent life-size chess board, a hooded figure over a dead and bleeding unicorn, as well as a discussion of how Harry's parents died years ago. The 2015 lavishly illustrated, larger-format edition features a new cover (different from the original U.S. cover pictured here) and more than 100 full-color illustrations by Jim Kay (A Monster Calls) that depict shimmering ghosts amid breathtaking scenes of Hogwarts, character portraits, and pages from magical textbooks. Parents who want to learn more about the series (and spin-off movies and games) can read our Harry Potter Age-by-Age Guide."

        "comment": "The gorgeous 2015 edition, featuring a new cover and showcasing more than 100 lovingly detailed illustrations by Jim Kay, will appeal to reluctant readers intimidated by the hefty text-only book. The illustrations decorate nearly every ink-stained page, and the play of perspective and light in each make them a wonderfully atmospheric addition to Rowling's story.."

        "comment": "Twists and turns make this first story in the series resemble a junior Grisham thriller in which loose ends are expertly tied and more threads become compellingly unraveled. Part of Harry's appeal is that he could be any ordinary 11-year-old boy,."
